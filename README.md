## What is it?

Paraphrasing from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression), "polynomial regression involves modeling the relationship between the variables x and y with an nth degree polynomial function."

A polynomial function takes the form

This program takes a set of (x,y) points as an input, and attempts to produce a polynomial that fits those points. This is known as curve fitting. The program does this by gradually adjusting the coefficients-- the `a` values.

## Inspiration

Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train Youtube channel. Specifically, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLp10CFIvxI).

I took this as an opportunity to get started with basic machine learning tasks. With the recent release of TensorFlow.js and my growing Javascript experience, I figured now was a perfect time to start tinkering!

## Contributing

Feel free to clone the repo and play around! The `sketch.js` file contains all of the core logic and is fairly well documented.

For any bugs/unexpected behavior/suggestions, mark it as an Issue on GitHub and I'll fix it ASAP! Or, even better, submit a Pull Request.
